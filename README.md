# purely-STDP-assemblies
This is the code for the article "Purely STDP-based assembly dynamics: stability, learning, overlaps, drift and aging" by Paul Manz and Raoul-Martin Memmesheimer, shared in accordance with PLOS CB's code availability guidelines. It uses the brain connectivity toolbox, https://pypi.org/project/bctpy/, for finding assembly structures within weight matrices. 
Functions are in stdp-assemblies.py, plots of the simulations are saved in the respective subdirectories of results/
